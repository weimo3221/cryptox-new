## Tips for verification

- The answer can potentially be in various formats, including plain text, LaTeX-formatted text, or multiple-choice options. These options may involve single or multiple selections, a numeric value, or a numerical value accompanied by units. Both the 'Real Answer' and the 'Model-generated Answer' may correspond to any of these response types. Exact string matching is not required; what matters is that the meaning or the options are consistent. In the case of multiple-choice questions, different orders are also acceptable.
